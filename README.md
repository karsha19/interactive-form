**FullStack Conference Registration Form**

This project enhances an interactive registration form for a fictional conference called "FullStack Conf" using JavaScript. The project uses the supplied HTML and CSS files, and adds customised and conditional behavior and interactivity to make the form more user-friendly.

**Features**

1)Validation of user input
2)Helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields
3)Usage of jQuery library to complete this project
4)Shorter and simplified syntax
5)Help with cross-browser compatibility

**Why jQuery**

The project uses jQuery instead of plain "vanilla" JavaScript. Although it's important for a developer to have a solid understanding and familiarity with plain vanilla JavaScript, it's also important to be able to understand and work with jQuery since it is so common and prevalent on the web.

#The benefits of using jQuery are:

1)Shorter and simplified syntax
2)Helps with cross-browser compatibility since jQuery deals with a lot of that stuff under the hood
3)A strong familiarity with jQuery will only make you a better developer since it enjoys a strong market share on the web.
